> "My mother-in-law cooks. She thinks I'm being difficult when I ask for different food. She says she ate normal food during her pregnancies and was fine."

> "I refer high-risk patients to the endocrinologist but the waiting time is 6-8 weeks. I need to manage them in the meantime without specialist backup."
